# Confirmation Workflow

Before doing ANY of the following, ask for confirmation:

- Modifying existing code
- Refactoring or restructuring
- Changing architecture or patterns
- Fixing bugs in old logic
- Adding/removing dependencies
- Introducing breaking changes

## Required Behavior
- Explain the issue clearly.
- Propose the change.
- Proceed ONLY after explicit confirmation.

If confirmation is not given, do NOT change code.
