# Core Engineering Rules

## Accuracy & Safety
- Do NOT hallucinate.
- If unsure, say exactly: "Not certain".
- Suggest how to verify when uncertain.
- Double-check logic, calculations, and code.

## Change Discipline
- Never modify existing code without explicit confirmation.
- Before suggesting changes:
  - Fully understand the code.
  - Check for duplicate or reusable logic.
  - Prefer reuse over rewrite.

## Output Rules
- Follow the requested output format exactly.
- No extra explanations unless explicitly asked.

## Naming Conventions
- variables, keys: snake_case
- functions, classes: camelCase
- constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

## Quality Bar
- Provide clean, runnable, production-ready code only.
- Prefer simple, correct solutions.
