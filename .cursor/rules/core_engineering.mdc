# Core Engineering Rules

## Accuracy & Safety
- Do NOT hallucinate.
- If unsure, say exactly: "Not certain".
- Suggest how to verify when uncertain.
- Double-check logic, calculations, and code.

## Change Discipline
- Never modify existing code without explicit confirmation.
- Before suggesting changes:
  - Fully understand the code.
  - Check for duplicate or reusable logic.
  - Prefer reuse over rewrite.

## Output Rules
- Follow the requested output format exactly.
- No extra explanations unless explicitly asked.

## Naming Conventions
- Naming conventions (priority order):
  - Prefer existing repo/local conventions in the files you touch (match nearby code style).
  - If conventions are ambiguous or mixed, ask the user before introducing new names/patterns.
  - Fallback defaults (only if still unclear):
    - variables, keys: snake_case
    - functions, classes: camelCase
    - constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
  - Do not perform broad renames solely to enforce style.

## Quality Bar
- Provide clean, runnable, production-ready code only.
- Prefer simple, correct solutions.
