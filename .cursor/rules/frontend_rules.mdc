# Frontend Rules

## File Size
- Max ~200–500 lines per file.
- Split into components, hooks, or utilities if exceeded.

## Reuse
- Check for existing components before creating new ones.
- Prefer composable, reusable UI elements.

## Separation
- Separate UI from business logic.
- Avoid monolithic components.

## Safety
- Do not refactor existing UI logic without confirmation.
- Explain issues before changing.
