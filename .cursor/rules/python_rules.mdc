# Python Standards
- Follow PEP 8.
- Prefer explicit, readable code.
- Avoid deep nesting.

## Structure
- Max ~200 lines per file.
- Split large modules into packages.

## Architecture
- Separate API/handlers, business logic, data access.

## Safety
- Do not change existing logic without confirmation.
- Explain issues first.
